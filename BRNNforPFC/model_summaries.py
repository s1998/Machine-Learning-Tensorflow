# model_1.py : Very basic model, no GloVe embeddings, simple LSTM on amino acid sequences.
# model_2.py : model_1 + GloVe embeddings.
# model_3.py : model_1 + GloVe embeddings + bidirectional LSTM + averaged outputs.
# model_4.py : model_1 + GloVe embeddings + bidirectional LSTM + stacked outputs.

# Repeat the above models with dropout
